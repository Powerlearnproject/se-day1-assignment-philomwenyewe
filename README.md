Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It's the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools of developing and maintain software systems to there highest quality
It plays major role in tech leading to creation of software systems that power various aspects of modern life

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1)mastering machine
2)mastering process
3)mastering communication

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1)Requirements - involves gathering and documentation of user needs and system requirements
2)Design - creating high level design of software architecture
3)Implentation - invoves writing of codes and building software according to the design
4)Testing - conducting tests to make sure software meets the highest quality standards
5)Deployment - Release of the software 
6)Maintanance - provision of ongoing support , giving updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Agile methodology allows collaboration and its open to any change while the waterfall requires everything to detailed before any work starts

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - responsible for writing codes and implement software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures software quality by designing and execute tests
Project Manager - oversees the plan, execution and deliver the software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

The IDEs provides better tools for writing, debugging and testing code, e.g Visual Studio Code while the Version Control System are tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members, e.g git 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

changing requirements
tight deadline
technical debt

stragetegies-are 1)effective communication
                 2)priortization of task
                 3)agile methodoligies
                 
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

unit - testing of individual modules of software
integration - testing interactions between different components
system - testing the entire system as a whole
acceptance - testing against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

It's all about crafting questions or statements to get the best response from Ai

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

"Tell me more about shoes" instead write  can you tell more about safety boots shoes 
The second prompt won't leave the Ai guessing about being asked something concerning the safety boots shoes
